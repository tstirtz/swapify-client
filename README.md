## Summary
The goal of Swapify is to help students save money. Students already spend thousands of dollars on tuition, they shouldn't have to spend hundreds more on text books when they can just swap them with their classmates on campus. Swapify facilitates this for the user. A user can post their text books that they want to swap and search all available text books to swap for. Users interact by sending a message to the owner of a book that they would like to swap for.
